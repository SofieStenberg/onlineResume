	<h1 class="title-header">My Hobbies</h1>
	<div class="hobby-intro" style="text-align: center;">
		<p>
			I have multiple different interests that occupy my spare time.<br />

	<div class="hobby-container">
		<div id="games" class="hobby-item">
			<h2 class="hobby-title">Play Games</h2>
			<p>
				I like playing games, both on the computer and board games. <br />
				Recent board games I have played are among others 
				Descent, 
				Codenames, 
				Trapwords, 
				and Elder Signs.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also have been roleplaying a bit. It has mostly been Dungeons & Dragons for now, 
				but I am also curious about testing out 
				Pathfinder, 
				Vampire the Masquerade, 
				Warhammer, S
				hadowrun,
				and Legend of the Five Rings.
			</p>

		<div id="miniatures" class="hobby-item">
			<h2 class="hobby-title">Paint Miniatures</h2>
			<p>
				I have mostly painted figures for Malifaux and Descent,
				but also bought some to have for roleplaying.
				Me and my partner eventually bought a printer, 
				So now we can paint even more figures!
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="swords" class="hobby-item">
			<h2 class="hobby-title">Swords and daggers</h2>
			<p>
				I like swords and daggers. <br />
				I have more swords on my walls than I have paintings!
			</p>

		<div id="nature" class="hobby-item">
			<h2 class="hobby-title">Out in the nature</h2>
			<p>
				I also like being out in the nature. <br />

				take my brother's boat out for some fishing.
