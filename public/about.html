	<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
	<p>
		
		I have multiple different interests that occupies my sparetime.<br />

	</p>

	<h2>Play Games</h2>
	<p>
		I like playing games, both on the computer and board games. <br />
		Recent board games I have played is among others 
		Descent,
		Codenames,
		Trapwords and
		Elder signs.
		 
	</p>
	<p>
		I also have been roleplaying a bit. It have mostly been Dungeons&Dragons for now, 
		but I am also curious in testing out  
		Pathfinder, 
		Vampire the masquerade, 
		Warhammer, 
		shadowrun and 
		Legend of the Five Rings. 
	</p>

	<h2>Paint Miniatures</h2>
	<p>
		I have mostley painted figures for Malifaux and Descent,
		but also bought some to have for the roleplaying.
		Me and my partner eventually bought a printer, 
		So now we can paint even more figures!
	</p>

	<h2>Swords and daggers</h2>
	<p>
		I like swords and daggers. <br />
		I have more swords on my walls than I have paintings!
	</p>

	<h2>Out in the nature</h2>
	<p>

		I like going out for walks or 
		take my brothers boat out for some fishing.
